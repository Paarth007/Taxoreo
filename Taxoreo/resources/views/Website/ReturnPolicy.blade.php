            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Before processing any refund, we reserve the right to make a best effort to
                complete the service. In case you are not satisfied with the service, a
                cancellation fee of 20% + earned fee + fee paid to the government would be

                applicable.

                Hence, all refunds will be subject to a minimum of 20% cancellation fee.
                Further, if Taxoreo has spent the time and resources to complete the
                engagement or incurred any other fee, such fees will be deducted on best
                judgement basis by the company and the balance will be refunded. Under any
                circumstance, Taxoreo shall be liable to refund only upto 80% of the fee
                paid by the client.

                Penalty or Tax Payment
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Taxoreo and its employees play the role of a corporate service provider.
                While, it is our responsibility to prepare the necessary filings, it is the
                clients responsibility to ensure accuracy and correctness. Hence, Taxoreo
                will not pay any penalties or taxes on behalf of its clients. Further,
                Taxoreo is not responsible or liable for any other cost incurred by the
                client related to the completion of the service that is out of scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Factors Outside our Control
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                We cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure.
                For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal
                reasons beyond the scope of Taxoreo service. In some cases, a government
                backlog or problems with the government platforms (e.g. MCA website, Income
                Tax website, FSSAI website) can lead to long delays before your process is
                complete. Similarly, Taxoreo does not guarantee the results or outcomes of
                the services rendered by our Associates on Nearest.Expert platform, who are
                not employed by Taxoreo. Problems like these are beyond our control and are
                not covered by this guarantee or eligible for refund. Hence, delay in
                processing of your file by the Government cannot be a reason for refund.
            </p>
            <p>
                Force Majeure
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
                Taxoreo shall not be considered in breach of its Satisfaction Guarantee
                policy or default under any terms of service, and shall not be liable to
                the Client for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of
                its obligations by reason of earthquake, flood, fire, storm, lightning,
                drought, landslide, hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, natural disaster,
                act of God or the public enemy, epidemic, famine or plague, action of a
                court or public authority, change in law, explosion, war, terrorism, armed
                conflict, labor strike, lockout, boycott or similar event beyond our
                reasonable control, whether foreseen or unforeseen (each a "Force Majeure
                Event").
